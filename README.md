## Concept

Hey thanks for checking out my app. I wanted to make a simple tool to find shows at home or on the road, as well as recommended shows from similar artists. Hope you enjoy!

It uses the getSimilarArtist endpoint of the last.fm API to find your searched artist and the 10 most similar (as decided by their algorithims), then creates a list of those artists with expandable sub-lists of shows. The shows are found via the events endpoint of the TickerMaster API. 

Thanks for your time!
