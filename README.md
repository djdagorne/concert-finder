Hey thanks for checking out my app. It's a simple app you can use to find online tickets for shows of artists you might be interested in. 

It uses the getSimilarArtist endpoint of the last.fm API to find your searched artist and the 10 most similar (as decided by their algorithims), then creates a list of those artists with expandable sub-lists of shows. The shows are found via the events endpoint of the TickerMaster API. 

Uses HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery
